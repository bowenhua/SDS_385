# Soft Thresholding and Lasso

This set of exercises concerns sparsity. For theoretical questions, please see my answers [here](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/5_sparsity/ex5.pdf).

For codes on soft thresholding, please refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/5_sparsity/soft_thresh.ipynb). For codes on lasso, see [this notebook](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/5_sparsity/lasso_CV.ipynb).
