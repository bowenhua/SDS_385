# Spatial Smoothing at Scale

[My notebook](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/8_spatial_smoothing_at_scale/kernel_smoothing.ipynb) for kernal smoothing.

[My solution](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/8_spatial_smoothing_at_scale/ex8.pdf) for theoretical problems on Laplacian smoothing, and [my codes](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/8_spatial_smoothing_at_scale/laplacian.ipynb) for the same problem.
