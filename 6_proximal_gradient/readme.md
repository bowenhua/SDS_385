# Proximal gradient descent

This set of exercises includes theoretical and implementation questions on proximal gradient descent.. For theoretical questions, please see my answers [here](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/6_proximal_gradient/ex6.pdf).

For my implementation of proximal gradient descent, please refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/bowenhua/SDS_385/blob/master/6_proximal_gradient/Proximal%20gradient%20method.ipynb).
